# webpack-cheatsheet

### What this is about?
This repository is for learning and experimenting new webpack features and tracking the issues that front-end devs faces while setting up a new project.

This repository can also serve as a bootstrap react/webpack app.

### How to Contribute?
If there is something that you have learned and want to share, all you have to do is:  
1. Checkout from master branch `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. Try to be as descriptive as possible while naming your feature branch.
2.  Work on this new branch and open a PR against `master`. Add proper description while opening PR.
3. Once your PR is approved please update Wiki referring this new feature and the branch for the same.


For now we are not going to merge these **experimental** features to master so that master can be used as barebone frontend app unless it's about tweaking the barebone app.
